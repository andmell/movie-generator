# movie-generator
A web application for generating a movie to watch based on user input.

## Description
This webpage was designed to allow for users to discover new movies on a given input. Additionally, a different input would allow the user to check to see if a title has any streaming services available. The motivation for this project was to allow people a method of finding a movie if they either didn't know what to search for, or needed a way to stream it online.

## Installation
No installation is required. To use this application, please navigate to the respective deployed GitHub page for use. Please click [here](https://andmell.github.io/movie-generator/) to visit the deployed site.

## Usage
Two different inputs will be provided for the user, which have different functions. The Discover section allows the user to find a movie based on Genre, year release, and rating. Once searched, the site will populate movies based on those inputs.

Additionally, a user can type in the name of a known movie, and the website will populate the page with movies matching that title. If any streaming services exist for any specific title, they will be listed with the movie, alongside links to that specific page.
